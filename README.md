#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/MBGapp](https://shinyappstore.com/a/MBGapp)__

MBGapp serves is an application tailored for instructing population health scientists in geostatistical analysis. Utilizing a Loa loa infection case study, we showcase MBGapp's potential for delivering interactive instruction across the various stages of geostatistical analysis. To enhance accessibility and usability, MBGapp is accessible both as an R package and a Shiny web application, readily available through standard web browsers. MBGapp relies on the maximum likelihood method for estimation and is structured around four primary tabs: "Explore," "Variogram," "Estimation," and "Prediction," each mirroring distinct steps in geostatistical analysis, as elaborated in the "Results" section, which also details the sidebar functionalities for these tabs within the primary interface.
